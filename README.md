# Description
Data is factual in the same way that data is truthful. Which is to say: not at all.

Data Cindy, Sherman Query is a double exposure workshop of data and data. We’ll understand data’s fact craft through the lens of data practices, like those of Cindy Sherman, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Thomas Ruff, and Amalia Ulman. Like data, data is an indexical, incomplete trace of the past. How do you create data personas with these traces? How does your past data represent your present? How can your personal data be framed, composed, and cropped to tell different stories?

We’ll work with simple software and custom scripts in Python to download, process, and interpret our personal data from Google search queries, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter data. From raw text and image dumps of this material, we will develop and develop a personal darkroom data practice, constructing datacollages, text compositions of alternate realities, and faux-autobiographies of new personas.

As in Cindy Sherman’s work, our personal data can be crafted differently to form different narratives. Done unto us outside of our control, the imposition of a persona is frightening. Created by ourselves, crafted narratives and personas can be empowering and exciting.

**Materials:**
A laptop, easy access to your own email & social media accounts.

**Audience:**
This workshop is primarily about narratives and representation. While we will use some scripts and Python code, no prior coding experience is necessary. An enthusiastic willingness to play data-dress-up is required.
